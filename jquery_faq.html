            The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System,
            with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values,
            and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values. Read more about the history of the arrowhead and
            other elements of NPS visual design.
            The NPS allows limited use of the NPS arrowhead when doing so contributes to our work. Learn how to request permission to use the arrowhead.</dd>
